# Employee Attrition Analysis and Retention Strategy

#### Objectives

This analysis focuses on understanding employee attrition patterns across various demographics, job roles, and departments, with the aim of providing actionable insights to enhance employee retention.

#### Data Cleaning and Preparation:
- The dataset extracted from an HR system, contained information about employee demographics, job roles, performance, satisfaction levels, and travel frequency.
- The dataset was processed to ensure accuracy and consistency by handling missing values and standardizing data formats.

#### Data Preparation and Segmentation:
- Key metrics such as Total Employee Count, Attrition Rate, and Active Employees were calculated.
- Segmentation was performed based on critical attributes, including job role, education level, performance rating, age group, gender, and distance to work.
- Grouped data by department (HR, R&D, Sales) and travel frequency for more insightful analysis.

#### Visualization in Excel:
- Pivot tables and charts were used to summarize data effectively.
- Bar charts, pie charts, and donut charts were utilized to visualize attrition trends and comparisons across different categories.
- Conditional formatting was likely applied to enhance readability (e.g., gender-based color codes and red for critical metrics).
